    0. Add enclosing top-level <reviews> tag

	1. Find & replace unescaped ampersands not followed by a space:
grep '&[a-zA-Z]' TrainingSet.xml | grep -ve '&quot' -ve '&amp' -ve '&lt' -ve '&gt'

	2. Find & replace other unescaped ampersands:
grep '& '
grep '_&'

    3. Add missing trailing semicolon to some '&quot' tokens

	4. Replace SUB control characters at (row, column):
(15993, 552), (17700, 1035), (23573, 45), (24605, [multiple]),
(33032, [multiple]), (47989, 67), (54518-20, [multiple]), (55331, 139),
(66360, 132 [found the "1/2" symbol in the original Amazon review!]),
(66694, [multiple - metalinguistic, see below])

Some SUB characters represented smart quotes, which I replaced with straight
quotes. Others were foreign characters apparently not legal in our charset; I
entered the English equivalent. In the "metalinguistic" case, the reviewer was
complaining about the presence or absence of certain Spanish characters
themselves. The easy fix meant changing the sense of his review in a small way.
